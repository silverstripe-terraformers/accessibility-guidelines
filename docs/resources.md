The NZ GOVT has created a digital standard/guideline for accessibility here: https://www.digital.govt.nz/standards-and-guidance/design-and-ux/accessibility/

Microsoft has [Sonder UI](https://github.com/microsoft/sonder-ui), "a collection of tested, accessible components and component pattern documentation." They've got a component library [Fluent UI](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui) which undergoes accessibility testing to a high standard. It's worth checking both the component documentation and the tests for the components if you're using them as inspiration to create accessibly standards

Project skeleton has a checklist for some primitive components: https://github.com/silverstripeltd/project-skeleton/blob/master/docs/accessibility.md

W3 has some really nice tutorials: https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/

The UK GOVT has put in a lot of effort into creating both [components](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/) and [patterns](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/) (e.g. what type of date field should I use?)
